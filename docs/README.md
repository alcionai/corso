# Corso documentation

Corso documentation uses [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) provides support for native diagrams in Markdown.

## Requirements

Developing documentation for Corso requires the following tools on your machine:

- `make`
- Docker

## Installation

```bash
make buildimage
```

## Live documentation development

```bash
make dev
```

This command starts a local development server within the Docker container and will expose docs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Generating Corso CLI docs

```bash
make genclidocs
```

Corso's CLI documents are auto generated. This command explicitly triggers generating these docs. This step will happen
automatically for the other commands where this is relevant.

## Building static documentation

```bash
make build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory for integration with any static contents hosting service.

## Style and linting

```bash
# Lint all docs
make check
# Lint specific files and/or folders
make check VALE_TARGET="README.md docs/concepts"
```

This command will lint all Markdown files and check them for style issues using the Docker container

## Documentation platform development

```bash
make shell
```

Use this command to interactively (and temporarily!) change the contents or
configuration of the live documentation container image (for example, when
experimenting with new plugins).
