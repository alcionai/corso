The automatic \u2018alternative designs for this slide\u2019\\nbutton? It\u2019s too good. I can\u2019t give up Microsoft 365.\\n\\nIf you did some work today, there\u2019s a very good chance you opened a Microsoft tool. M365 is used by\\n[more than a million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/983321/worldwide-office-365-user-numbers-by-country/)\\ncompanies worldwide, and nearly 880,000 companies in the U.S. use the software suite. But with that widespread usage\\ncomes risk, business-critical data is at risk of loss or corruption, if not securely backed up and protected.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The problem with built-in backups\\n\\nA couple of years back I took the time to get the AWS \u2018baby cert,\u2019 their first certification. The focus of the\\nmaterial surprised me, along with learning about the most popular AWS products and their benefits, you had to learn\\ncold all the things that AWS will not do for you. AWS won\u2019t alert you to poor performance on your applications. It\\nwon\u2019t automatically scale down your instances. And while AWS and the other public cloud providers completely meet their\\npromised SLA, they do not promise to deliver the backups that you expect them to deliver.\\n\\n\u201cI accidentally deleted the customer DB,\u201d isn\u2019t a situation that public cloud companies are built to prevent or\\nameliorate. Fundamentally, on all public clouds, backups are a shared responsibility between administrator and service.\\nFor another example, see this from Microsoft\'s Diana Kelley:\\n[\\"Driving data security is a shared responsibility, here\u2019s how you can protect yourself\\"](https://www.statista.com/statistics/983321/worldwide-office-365-user-numbers-by-country/)\\n\\n## Data Loss Happens\\n\\nLet\u2019s talk about the stats on data loss:\\n\\nData loss can result from accidental or intentional deletion, cyber-attacks and malware, a poorly executed migration,\\nor the cancellation of a software license, among other reasons. For example,\\n[40% \u2013 2 out of 5 servers](https://www.veeam.com/blog/data-loss-2022.html) \u2013 had at least one or more outages over the\\npast 12 months. And cybercrime is on a continual rise \u2013 the average number of data breaches and cyberattacks were\\n[up 15.1% in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2022/06/03/alarming-cyber-statistics-for-mid-year-2022-that-you-need-to-know/?sh=642204357864),\\ncompared with the previous year. As of 2022, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. was $9.44 million.\\n\\n## The limitations of backup tools\\n\\nWhile many backup and recovery solutions exist for M365 data, many lack comprehensive workflows, are hard to use and\\nimplement, or are cost prohibitive. Yet reliable and regular backups are critical for ensuring your data is protected\\nand always available, in case of a breach, unexpected server failure or failed data migration.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s why we built Corso, a free and secure, 100% open-source solution that protects M365 data by securely and\\nefficiently backing up all business-critical data to object storage.\\n\\n## Why Corso?\\n\\nCorso is purpose-built for protection of your M365 organization account (this tool doesn\u2019t work with consumer accounts)\\nwith easy-to-use comprehensive backup and restore workflows that reduce backup time and administrative overhead,\\nimprove time-to-recovery, and replace unreliable scripts or workarounds. It enables high-throughput, high-tolerance\\nbackups that feature end-to-end encryption, deduplication, and compression. Plus, it\u2019s compatible with any S3-compliant\\nobject storage system: AWS S3 (including Glacier Instant Access), Google Cloud Storage and Backblaze. (Azure Blob\\nsupport is coming soon).\\n\\nCorso\u2019s secure backup protects against accidental data loss, service provider downtime and malicious threats, including\\nransomware attacks. Plus, a robust user community provides a venue for admins to share and learn about data protection\\nand find best practices for how to security configure their M365 environments. As a member of the community, you\u2019ll\\nhave access to blogs, forums, and discussion, as well as updates on public and feedback-driven development.\\n[Join the Corso community on Discord](https://discord.gg/63DTTSnuhT).\\n\\n## Low-Cost and Highly Secure\\n\\nCorso\'s source code is licensed under the Apache v2 open-source license. It\u2019s open source, and it\u2019s free \u2013 which makes\\nit the perfect solution for cost-conscious teams. And that\u2019s not where the cost savings end, Corso\u2019s flexible retention\\npolicies and ability to compress and deduplicate data efficiently before sending it to storage, helps reduce storage\\ncosts, as well.\\n\\n## Interested in Trying Corso?\\n\\nCorso is currently a tool in alpha to give you a CLI for backups of your M365 data.\\n[Follow the quickstart guide](https://docs.corsobackup.io/) to start protecting your business-critical M365 data in\\njust a few minutes. Because Corso is currently in alpha, it should NOT be used in production.\\n\\nCorso supports Microsoft 365 Exchange and OneDrive, with SharePoint and Teams support in active development. Coverage\\nfor more services, beyond M365, will expand based on the interests and needs of the community.\\n\\nSo, your feedback is critical for our work on this tool! Please\\n[tell us what you think of Corso](https://discord.gg/63DTTSnuhT)."}]}')}}]);
