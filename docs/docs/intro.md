# Introduction

## Overview

Corso is the first open-source tool that aims to assist IT admins with the critical task of protecting their
Microsoft 365 data. It provides a reliable, secure, and efficient data protection engine. Admins decide where to store
the backup data and have the flexibility to perform backups of their desired service through an intuitive interface.
As Corso evolves, it can become a great building block for more complex data protection workflows.

Corso supports M365 Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams. Coverage for more services, possibly
beyond M365, will expand based on the interest and needs of the community.

## Getting started

You can follow the [Quick Start](../quickstart) guide for an end-to-end Corso walk through. Alternatively, follow
the instructions in the [Corso Setup](../setup/concepts) section to dive into the details on how to configure and
run Corso.
