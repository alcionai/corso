# Introduction

## Overview

Corso is the first open-source tool that aims to assist admins with the critical task of protecting SaaS service data.
It provides a reliable, secure, and efficient data protection engine. Admins decide where backup data is stored and
have the flexibility to execute backups of their desired service through an intuitive interface. As Corso evolves, it
can become a great building block for more complex data protection workflows.

Corso is initially focused on protecting data in Microsoft 365 services such as Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and
Teams. The goals is to expand coverage for additional services beyond M365 based on the interest and needs of the
community.

## Getting Started
