The Corso team is all about making sure that your data never goes away.
We've worked hard making the industry's only free and open-source tool for backing up Microsft 365.
And that's why we're not letting anything die, certainly not 2006's best personal media player, the Zune.

...look, this all made sense when I bought the Zune, and found someone to refurbish it. Just play along with me here, okay?

## A technology whose time has come

In many ways, the Zune was ahead of its time. Its wifi could stream music, and share your own media with other
Zunes on the local network.

It also, to my knowledge, was the first personal media player to come in brown. This Zune isn't brown, it's black,
but they did make brown ones.

*Look at that, brown. What a time to be alive.*

## All right Nica, I can't possibly get more excited, how can I win this prize?

It's simple. Just:

* [give Corso a try](https://corsobackup.io/docs/quickstart/)
* fill out the [Corso feedback form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/mRVNKqeKDp)

That's it! If you do that I will hold a drawing in a few weeks, and send the lucky winner the working Zune that
I have on my desk at this very moment.
