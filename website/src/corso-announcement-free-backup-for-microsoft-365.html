                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Have you had it with Google sheets? So have I. Excel is my home. It’s where I write all my best formulae. And what about PowerPoint? The way it just finds stock photos for you? The automatic ‘alternative designs for this slide’ button? It’s too good. I can’t give up Microsoft 365. </p>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">If you did some work today, there’s a very good chance you opened a Microsoft tool. M365 is used by <a class="text-indigo-600" target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/983321/worldwide-office-365-user-numbers-by-country/">more than a million</a> companies worldwide, and nearly 880,000 companies in the U.S. use the software suite. But with that widespread usage comes risk, business-critical data is at risk of loss or corruption, if not securely backed up and protected. </p>

                                <p class="text-base pb-4">A couple of years back I took the time to get the AWS ‘baby cert,’ their first certification. The focus of the material surprised me, along with learning about the most popular AWS products and their benefits, you had to learn cold all the things that AWS will not do for you. AWS won’t alert you to poor performance on your applications. It won’t automatically scale down your instances. And while AWS and the other public cloud providers completely meet their promised SLA, they do not promise to deliver the backups that you expect them to deliver. </p>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">“I accidentally deleted the customer DB,” isn’t a situation that public cloud companies are built to prevent or ameliorate. Fundamentally, on all public clouds, backups are a shared responsibility between administrator and service. For another example, see this from Microsoft's Diana Kelley: <a class="text-indigo-600" target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/983321/worldwide-office-365-user-numbers-by-country/">"Driving data security is a shared responsibility, here’s how you can protect yourself"</a></p>

                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Let’s talk about the stats on data loss: </p>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Data loss can result from accidental or intentional deletion, cyber-attacks and malware, a poorly executed migration, or the cancellation of a software license, among other reasons. For example, <a class="text-indigo-600" target="_blank" href="https://www.veeam.com/blog/data-loss-2022.html">40% – 2 out of 5 servers</a> – had at least one or more outages over the past 12 months. And cybercrime is on a continual rise – the average number of data breaches and cyberattacks were <a class="text-indigo-600" target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2022/06/03/alarming-cyber-statistics-for-mid-year-2022-that-you-need-to-know/?sh=642204357864">up 15.1% in 2021</a>, compared with the previous year. As of 2022, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. was $9.44 million. </p>
                                <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl leading-normal font-medium" id="the-limitations-of-backup-tools">The limitations of backup tools</h2>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">While many backup and recovery solutions exist for M365 data, many lack comprehensive workflows, are hard to use and implement, or are cost prohibitive. Yet reliable and regular backups are critical for ensuring your data is protected and always available, in case of a breach, unexpected server failure or failed data migration. </p>

                                </div><p class="text-base pb-4">And that’s why we built Corso, a free and secure, 100% open-source solution that protects M365 data by securely and efficiently backing up all business-critical data to object storage.  </p>
                                <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl leading-normal font-medium" id="why-corso">Why Corso?</h2>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Corso is purpose-built for protection of your M365 organization account (this tool doesn’t work with consumer accounts) with easy-to-use comprehensive backup and restore workflows that reduce backup time and administrative overhead, improve time-to-recovery, and replace unreliable scripts or workarounds. It enables high-throughput, high-tolerance backups that feature end-to-end encryption, deduplication, and compression. Plus, it’s compatible with any S3-compliant object storage system: AWS S3 (including Glacier Instant Access), Google Cloud Storage and Backblaze. (Azure Blob support is coming soon).  </p>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Corso’s secure backup protects against accidental data loss, service provider downtime and malicious threats, including ransomware attacks. Plus, a robust user community provides a venue for admins to share and learn about data protection and find best practices for how to security configure their M365 environments. As a member of the community, you’ll have access to blogs, forums, and discussion, as well as updates on public and feedback-driven development. <a class="text-indigo-600" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/63DTTSnuhT">Join the Corso community on Discord</a>. </p>
                                <h2 class="mb-4 text-3xl leading-normal font-medium" id="low-cost-and-highly-secure">Low-Cost and Highly Secure</h2>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Corso's source code is licensed under the Apache v2 open-source license. It’s open source, and it’s free – which makes it the perfect solution for cost-conscious teams. And that’s not where the cost savings end, Corso’s flexible retention policies and ability to compress and deduplicate data efficiently before sending it to storage, helps reduce storage costs, as well.  </p>

                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Corso is currently a tool in alpha to give you a CLI for backups of your M365 data. <a class="text-indigo-600" target="_blank" href="https://docs.corsobackup.io/">Follow the quickstart guide</a> to start protecting your business-critical M365 data in just a few minutes. Because Corso is currently in alpha, it should NOT be used in production. </p>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">Corso supports Microsoft 365 Exchange and OneDrive, with SharePoint and Teams support in active development. Coverage for more services, beyond M365, will expand based on the interests and needs of the community.  </p>
                                <p class="text-base pb-4">So, your feedback is critical for our work on this tool! Please <a class="text-indigo-600" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/63DTTSnuhT">tell us what you think of Corso</a>. </p>
