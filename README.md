# Corso

Corso is the first open-source tool that aims to assist admins with the
critical task of protecting SaaS service data. It provides a reliable, secure,
and efficient data protection engine. Admins decide where backup data is
stored and have the flexibility to execute backups of their desired service
through an intuitive interface. As Corso evolves, it can become a great
building block for more complex data protection workflows.

Corso is initially focused on protecting data in Microsoft 365 services such
as Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams. The goals is to expand coverage
for additional services, M365 or others, over time based on the interest and 
needs of the community.
